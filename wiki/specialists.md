# Specialists

## Overview

Specialists are units that can be hired on Stars or Carriers, provided the Carrier is currently orbiting a star (meaning, not moving). Specialists can be bought using specialist tokens by default, and with credits in games with the "buy specialists with credits" setting. Specialists, which provide certain buffs and debuffs for the Carrier or Star it is hired on, must be understood in order to be used effecively, which this page is meant to assist with.

## Properties

Specialists have certain properties that apply to all or most specialists, which are listed here:

 - Only one specialist may be hired in a carrier or star at a time.
  - When a specialist is hired in a carrier or star that already contains a specialist, the previous specialist is replaced by the newly hired one.
 - When a carrier containing a specialist is destroyed in combat, the specialist is destroyed as well.
 - When a star containing a specialist is captured in combat, the new owner of the star owns the specialist as well.
  - ...Unless the star contains a Demolition Controller.
 - When gifting a carrier that contains a specialist, the specialist is destroyed when the carrier is recieved.
 - Specialists cannot be manually destroyed; Only replaced.
  - In the case of carrier specialists, scuttling the carrier will cause the specialist to be destroyed.
 - Specialists effects only apply locally, meaning only to the star or carrier it's on.
 - A specialist cannot cause tech (i.e. weapons, scanning, terraforming, etc) to go below a level of 1.
  - With weapons specialists, when defender bonus applies, it cannot cause weapons to go below a level of 2.
   - ...Unless an Infiltrator is used, which can cause weapons to drop to 1 even when defender bonus is applied. 

## Stellar Specialists

Stellar specialists are specialists that can only be hired on stars.

# Orbital Array

//insert image

**Cost:** 1 Token
**In-game Description:** "Grants +1 Scanning Range to the Star."

**Use:** See the resources, infrastructure, specialists, and ship count for stars and carriers that are just out of your scanning range. In defensive use, you will be able to see carriers being sent to your stars from farther away, giving you more time to react. In offensive use, you can attack stars from farther away with better information on your opponent's capability to defend.

# Space Dock

//insert image

**Cost:** 2 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "Grants +2 Manufacturing, -1 Terraforming to the star."

**Use:** The Space Dock is best used early game on your capital star (the star that starts with infrastructure, 5 industry by default) in order to speed up its ship production, either for early rushes or defense against said rushes. 

# Atmosphere Processor

//insert image

**Cost:** 2 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "Grants +3 Terraforming, -1 Scanning to the Star."

**Use:** Extra terraforming makes infrastructure cheaper to build. However, the Atmosphere Processor is overshadowed by the World Builder in terms of saving costs, so it is not reccomended to use the Atmosphere Processor in most cases.

# Orbital Cannon

//insert image

**Cost:** 2 Tokens 
**In-game Description:** "Grants +1 Weapons, -1 Scanning, -1 Terraforming to the Star."

**Use:** There is no reason to ever use the Orbital Cannon. It is objectively better to use a Lieutenant instead of an Orbital Cannon because for the same cost (plus 25 credits for buying a carrier, but that is usually a negligable cost) you can have +1 weapons, but it's mobile and does not debuff the star.

# Warp Scrambler

//insert image

**Cost:** 3 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "Locks the Warp Gate at the Star to prevent other players from using it. Weapons -1."

**Use:** Later on in any game, you will find yourself using Warp Gates in order to transport ships between your stars at speedy rates. The main drawback to using Warp Gates is that your opponents may use Warp Gates as well, however this specialist negates that drawback. The Warp Scrambler is a very powerful specialist as it allows you to take advantage of a Warp Gate's mobility while denying your opponents from using it.

# Scrambler

//insert image

**Cost:** 3 Tokens
**In-game Description:** Prevents other players from seeing how many ships are garrisoned at the Star.

**Use:** There is no reason to use the Stellar version of the Scrambler. The Carrier version of the Scrambler is objectively better to use because it is mobile.

# War Machine

//insert image

**Cost:** 5 Tokens
**In-game Description:** Deducts 1 from the Star's natural resources every tick, +5 Manufacturing, +5 Weapons. This specialist retires if the star reaches 0 natural resources.

**Use:** There are two main reasons to use the War Machine. One, for defensive purposes, and two, for a quick burst of ship production. If a large amount of ships are headed towards one of your stars, you can build a War Machine right before the ships land in order to gain a large damage boost in the battle, often resulting in keeping the star for the cost of 5 tokens. On the other hand, if you need to prepare to attack or defend, you can use War Machines for a short term boost in ship production. Keep in mind that War Machines are good in the short term, however the fact that it deducts resources may be destructive in the long term. Don't use War Machines if you don't have an immediate plan or reason for using them, and remember to always replace War Machines with another specialist once the star reaches 1 natural resources, in order to prevent it from becoming a dead star.

# Demolition Controller

//insert image

**Cost:** 5 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "If the Star is captured, all infrastructure is destroyed."

**Use:** In most cases it is not worth buying a Demolition Controller. The cost of buying a Demolition Controller is often less than your opponent will lose by the infrastructure being destroyed.

# Research Station

//insert image

**Cost:** 5 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "The Star's Science infrastructure contributes x2 to research. -3 Terraforming, -3 Weapons, +1 Scanning."

**Use:** The Research Station is often overshadowed by the World Builder and the Trade Port. It is not useless per se, but it is not used very much.

# World Builder

//insert image

**Cost:** 10 Tokens 
**In-game Description:** "Adds 1 to the Star's natural resources every tick, -3 Scanning, -5 Weapons."

**Use:** The World Builder is one of the most powerful specialists (When hiring using tokens. When hiring using credits, the viability of the World Builder is debatable). Hire it on stars that are not likely to be attacked in the future. With the World Builder, the cost of infrastructure becomes significantly cheaper over time due to the increasing natural resources on the stars its hired on. In addition, when hiring a War Machine on a star that has been using a World Builder, the War Machine can stay hired for much longer due to the World Builder increasing the natural resources on the star.

# Trade Port

//insert image

**Cost:** 10 Tokens
**In-game Description:** "The Star's Economy infrastructure contributes x2 to economy production. -5 Terraforming, -3 Weapons, +1 Scanning."

**Use:** There comes a point in the end-game where increasing the natural resources on a star brings diminishing returns. At this point, the increased credit gain from Trade Ports will overweigh the decreased costs from World Builders in terms of the ability to construct more infrastructure. That is when you want to replace your World Builders with Trade Ports.

# Financial Analyst

//insert image

**Cost:** 10 Tokens
**In-game Description:** The star produces 1 credit per tick for each point of science on the star.

**Use:** The Financial Analyst is usually less useful than the Trade Port. That is because for a Financial Analyst to produce more credits than the Trade Port, there must be (assuming 20 tick cycles) at least half as much science infrastructure as economic infrastructure. For this reason, Financial Analysts are not often used.
