# Specialists

*Last updated: 23 July, 2021*

## Overview

Specialists are units that can be hired on Stars or Carriers, provided the Carrier is currently orbiting a star (meaning, not moving). Specialists can be bought using specialist tokens by default, and with credits in games with the "buy specialists with credits" setting. Specialists, which provide certain buffs and debuffs for the Carrier or Star it is hired on, must be understood in order to be used effecively, which this page is meant to assist with.

## Properties

Specialists have certain properties that apply to all or most specialists, which are listed here:

 * Only one specialist may be hired in a carrier or star at a time.
 -   When a specialist is hired in a carrier or star that already contains a specialist, the previous specialist is replaced by the newly hired one.
 * When a carrier containing a specialist is destroyed in combat, the specialist is destroyed as well.
 * When a star containing a specialist is captured in combat, the new owner of the star owns the specialist as well.
 -   ...Unless the star contains a Demolition Controller.
 * When gifting a carrier that contains a specialist, the specialist is destroyed when the carrier is received.
 * Specialists cannot be manually destroyed; Only replaced.
 -   In the case of carrier specialists, scuttling the carrier will cause the specialist to be destroyed.
 * Specialists effects only apply locally, meaning only to the star or carrier it's on.
 * A specialist cannot cause tech (i.e. weapons, scanning, terraforming, etc) to go below a level of 1.
 -   With weapons specialists, when defender bonus applies, it cannot cause weapons to go below a level of 2.
 +    ...Unless an Infiltrator is used, which can cause weapons to drop to 1 even when defender bonus is applied.
 * If you are using multiple weapons buff specialists in combat at the same time, only the specialist that gives the highest buff counts.
 -   Because the Infiltrator gives a debuff instead of a buff, it can function at the same time as a weapons buff specialist.  

## Stellar Specialists

Stellar specialists are specialists that can only be hired on stars.

### Orbital Array

**Cost:** 1 Token

**In-game Description:** "Grants +1 Scanning Range to the Star."

**Use:** See the resources, infrastructure, specialists, and ship count for stars and carriers that are just out of your scanning range. In defensive use, you will be able to see carriers being sent to your stars from farther away, giving you more time to react. In offensive use, you can attack stars from farther away with better information on your opponent's capability to defend. In addition, Orbital Arrays can help you find stars to colonize in Dark Galaxy games, and allow you to trade with others without putting too much scientific investment in scanning early game.

### Space Dock

**Cost:** 2 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +2 Manufacturing, -1 Terraforming to the star."

**Use:** The Space Dock is best used early game on your capital star (the star that starts with infrastructure, 5 industry by default) in order to speed up its ship production, either for early rushes or defense against said rushes. 

### Atmosphere Processor

**Cost:** 2 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +3 Terraforming, -1 Scanning to the Star."

**Use:** Extra terraforming makes infrastructure cheaper to build. However, the Atmosphere Processor is overshadowed by the World Builder in terms of saving costs, so it is not reccomended to use the Atmosphere Processor in most cases.

### Orbital Cannon

**Cost:** 2 Tokens 

**In-game Description:** "Grants +1 Weapons, -1 Scanning, -1 Terraforming to the Star."

**Use:** There is no reason to ever use the Orbital Cannon. It is objectively better to use a Lieutenant instead of an Orbital Cannon because for the same cost (plus 25 credits for buying a carrier, but that is usually a negligable cost) you can have +1 weapons, but it's mobile and does not debuff the star.

### Warp Scrambler

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Locks the Warp Gate at the Star to prevent other players from using it. Weapons -1."

**Use:** Later on in any game, you will find yourself using Warp Gates in order to transport ships between your stars at speedy rates. The main drawback to using Warp Gates is that your opponents may use Warp Gates as well, however this specialist negates that drawback. The Warp Scrambler is a very powerful specialist as it allows you to take advantage of a Warp Gate's mobility while denying your opponents from using it.

### Scrambler

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** Prevents other players from seeing how many ships are garrisoned at the Star.

**Use:** There is no reason to use the Stellar version of the Scrambler. The Carrier version of the Scrambler is objectively better to use because it is mobile.

### War Machine

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** Deducts 1 from the Star's natural resources every tick, +5 Manufacturing, +5 Weapons. This specialist retires if the star reaches 0 natural resources.

**Use:** There are two main reasons to use the War Machine. One, for defensive purposes, and two, for a quick burst of ship production. If a large amount of ships are headed towards one of your stars, you can build a War Machine right before the ships land in order to gain a large damage boost in the battle, often resulting in keeping the star for the cost of 5 tokens. On the other hand, if you need to prepare to attack or defend, you can use War Machines for a short term boost in ship production. Keep in mind that War Machines are good in the short term, however the fact that it deducts resources may be destructive in the long term. Don't use War Machines if you don't have an immediate plan or reason for using them, and remember to always replace War Machines with another specialist once the star reaches 1 natural resources, in order to prevent it from becoming a dead star.

### Demolition Controller

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "If the Star is captured, all infrastructure is destroyed."

**Use:** In most cases it is not worth buying a Demolition Controller. The cost of buying a Demolition Controller is often more than your opponent will lose by the infrastructure being destroyed.

### Research Station

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "The Star's Science infrastructure contributes x2 to research. -3 Terraforming, -3 Weapons, +1 Scanning."

**Use:** The Research Station is often overshadowed by the World Builder and the Trade Port. It is not useless per se, but it is not used very much.

### World Builder

**Cost:** 10 Tokens 

**In-game Description:** "Adds 1 to the Star's natural resources every tick, -3 Scanning, -5 Weapons."

**Use:** The World Builder is one of the most powerful specialists (When hiring using tokens. When hiring using credits, the viability of the World Builder is debatable). Hire it on stars that are not likely to be attacked in the future. With the World Builder, the cost of infrastructure becomes significantly cheaper over time due to the increasing natural resources on the stars its hired on. In addition, when hiring a War Machine on a star that has been using a World Builder, the War Machine can stay hired for much longer due to the World Builder increasing the natural resources on the star.

### Trade Port

**Cost:** 10 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "The Star's Economy infrastructure contributes x2 to economy production. -5 Terraforming, -3 Weapons, +1 Scanning."

**Use:** There comes a point in the end-game where increasing the natural resources on a star brings diminishing returns. At this point, the increased credit gain from Trade Ports will overweigh the decreased costs from World Builders in terms of the ability to construct more infrastructure. That is when you want to replace your World Builders with Trade Ports.

### Financial Analyst

**Cost:** 10 Tokens

**In-game Description:** The star produces 1 credit per tick for each point of science on the star.

**Use:** The Financial Analyst is usually less useful than the Trade Port. That is because for a Financial Analyst to produce more credits than the Trade Port, there must be (assuming 20 tick cycles) at least half as much science infrastructure as economic infrastructure. For this reason, Financial Analysts are not often used.

## Carrier Specialists

### Pathfinder

**Cost:** 1 Token

**In-game Description:** Grants +1 Hyperspace Range to the carrier.

**Use:** When expanding into neutral stars and finding a new star that is just out of reach, a Pathfinder can be used to get there without having to wait for another level of Hyperspace to develop.

### Lieutenant

**Cost:** 2 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +1 Weapons, -1 Hyperspace Range to the carrier."

**Use:** Can be used to assist in attacks and defense. The lieutenant is especially effective in the early game and games with a locked weapons value, due to the weapon buff being more effective when neither side has very much weapons tech. The Lieutenant pairs well with the Infiltrator, because the weapons buff to yourself stacks with the weapons debuff to the opponent.

### Admiral

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants x1.5 Speed, -1 Weapons, -2 Hyperspace Range to the carrier."

**Use:** The Admiral is usually overshadowed by the Raider, but since the Admiral is 2 tokens cheaper than the Raider, it can be hired when you're short on tokens and/or there's a need to spend tokens on another specialist. All speed specialists can be used defensively to transport a lot of ships to one star before it's attacks, or, if you and your oppenent have a high enough weapons level to ignore the weapons debuff, used for attacks on opponent stars.

### Colonel

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +2 Weapons, -1 Hyperspace Range, x0.75 Speed to the carrier."

**Use:** Can be used to assist in attacks and defense. In most cases, the Colonel will be used for defense rather than attack because a decrease in carrier speed is often very detrimental to the effectiveness of attacks due to the time it gives for the opponent to react. This is, except for during the early game, where players have less weapons tech and therefore weapons specialists are more powerful. For this reason, the colonel is a good early game rushing tool, due to its relatively low cost combined with a +2 weapons which can be crucial in early game battles.

### Explorer

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +3 Hyperspace Range, -1 Weapons to the carrier."

**Use:** Usually, the explorer is not used in any situation other than capturing "rogue" neutral stars, which are stars that spawn far from the rest of the galaxy. A potential use of the Explorer is for overnight attacks, where if your opponent has an unprotected star with a warp gate behind their front lines and outside your hyperspace range, you can use an explorer to attack the weak star, and potentially capture it provided you predict your opponent's sleep schedule correctly.

### Scrambler

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Prevents other players from seeing how many ships the carrier has."

**Use:** The Scrambler is best used in the early and mid game, where players don't yet have high enough scanning, which keeps scramblers useful as scramblers rely on a lack of information to function. One of the biggest things to consider when attacking someone is how they will react and defend. The way people generally defend is based on information, namely the amount of ships being sent. However, this is thrown off when a scrambler is used, as, when used correctly, a defender will have no idea how many ships are being sent their way. It could be 1 ship, or it could be a million. This will result in either you capturing a star using the scrambler or causing a diversion because the opponent over-compensates on defending. Because tactics are decided by information, the scrambler can win what seems like a losing war just by denying information.

### Infiltrator

**Cost:** 3 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "When participating in combat, the enemy fights with -1 Weapons."

**Use:** Similarly to the Lieutenant, the Infiltrator can be used for attack and defense, however the Infiltrator is slightly more effective at attack due to the lack of debuffs it has. It is also most effective early in the game where neither side has much in terms of weapons tech. The most important property about the Infiltrator though, is that because instead of a buff to yourself, it gives a debuff to your enemy, it is possible to use both an Infiltrator and another weapons specialist and have both of them effective in battle.

### General

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +3 Weapons, -1 Hyperspace Range, x0.5 Speed to the carrier."

**Use:** While technically, the General can be used for attack, it is really most useful in defense because the 0.5x speed makes it significantly less viable in attack. With the General and Destroyer, it is best to think that they are planetary specialists that may be transported between your stars.

### Smuggler

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants x2 Speed, -1 Hyperspace Range, -1 Weapons to the carrier."

**Use:** There is rarely a situation where one would want to use a Smuggler over a Raider. By the time one can afford to use either a Smuggler or Raider, the hyperspace debuff is significantly more damaging than the extra weapons debuff the Raider has. 

### Warp Stabilizer

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Warp Scramblers do not affect the carrier."

**Use:** The Warp Stabilizer is best used for overnight attacks. This is because if your opponent sees your Warp Stabilizer attack, they can simply destroy the warp gate, giving them more time to react to the attack. If your opponent is asleep, the warp stabilizer can use the 3x speed bonus to arrive before your opponent wakes, giving them no chance of defending the star you attacked. 

### Raider

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Carrier travels at x2 Speed, -2 Weapons. The carrier is awarded x2 star capture rewards for destroying infrastructure."

**Use:** The Raider is generally the best specialist for attacking in the mid-late game, as the lieutenant and infiltrator become less useful. At a point in the game, weapons becomes too high and manufacturing becomes high enough that the extra speed is saving more ships (by not allowing more time for enemy ships to be produced by manufacturing) than ships are being lost by losing weapons. The extra star capture rewards are an added bonus for using this specialist for attack.

### Pirate

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +3 Weapons in carrier-to-carrier combat, -2 Weapons in carrier-to-star combat and x1.5 Speed."

**Use:** Pirates are best used as a counter-attacking tool. If you have a star that is being attacked and need to send reinforcements, you can use the Pirate to get ships there quickly, then attack star the opponent's carrier came from in order to activate the +3 weapons. If your opponent does not have any ships defending the star your Pirate will attack afterwards, you can not only defend your star, but gain one in the process.

### Marauder

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "The carrier does not participate in carrier-to-carrier combat. x1.5 Speed, -2 Hyperspace Range, -1 Weapons."

**Use:** The Marauder has a similar use to the Pirate as a counter-attacking tool. The difference between the Pirate and the Marauder is that while the Pirate is best used when you have the ships to effectively defend, the Marauder is best used when you *don't* have enough ships to effectively defend. The idea with using the Marauder is that even if you lose your star that is being attacked, you can capture one of your opponent's stars if they left the star behind their carrier undefended.

### Stellar Bomb

**Cost:** 5 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Reignites a dead star with 10 Natural Resources, the Stellar Bomb will be destroyed but the carrier will survive. x0.5 Speed."

**Use:** If you capture a dead star, you should reignite it as soon as there isn't an imminent risk of someone else capturing it, because a star must be alive in order for you to build infrastructure on it.

### Destroyer

**Cost:** 10 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "Grants +5 Weapons, -3 Hyperspace Range, x0.5 Speed to the carrier."

**Use:** In many cases, the War Machine is better than the Destroyer because the War Machine has the same +5 weapons buff but at half the cost. Unlike the War Machine, it is technically possible to attack with the Destroyer, but by the time the Destroyer is affordable, the Raider is a much better attack option. However, while it is twice as expensive as the War Machine, the Destroyer has one advantage over it which is sustainability. If you know a star is going to be attacked multiple times and you require a weapons buff on it, you may want to consider the Destroyer over the War Machine, because while the War Machine must be disassembled if you don't wish to spend natural resources, the Destroyer gives no debuffs to the star it's on.

### Coward

**Cost:** 10 Tokens

**In-game Description:** "The carrier does not participate in carrier-to-carrier combat. x2 Speed."

**Use:** While the Coward techically has an advantage over the Marauder with its extra speed, it's difficult to justify spending 5 extra tokens for 2x speed versus 1.5x speed. It's also difficult to spend 10 tokens just to trade 1 star for 1 star as the Marauder does. It seems that the only reason to use the Coward is that if your opponent is 1 star away from winning the game, you can use the Coward to capture an opponent star before your opponent captures one of your stars, if the Marauder is too slow to capture before your opponent does. In this way, it can be used as a desperate attempt to delay the game, as it doesn't matter how efficiently you spend your tokens if the game is lost anyway.
